The files and folders are taken from a working setup.
Blindly running install.sh could work for you without 
further configuration, if:

	- You are running OpenBSD 5.2 i386
	- Your wireless Network card was named athn0
	- Your wired Network card was named alc0
	- You wanted your wireless network to be 10.0.3.1/24
	- Your wired network was 10.0.1.1/24
	- Your default router was at 10.0.1.2
	- You had no existing system configuration that mattered

In all other cases, you will need to adjust the example config files
to match your own setup, make backups of /etc/pf.conf etc, and only
then copy over the given example configuration files.
